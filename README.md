## Description

This weather app is designed to give you the current weather and five day forecast for any city you enter! Whether it be in the US or outside, this app will display the temperature, wind speed, and humidity averages for the current day and five days out. It will display an accompanying weather image as well. This web application will also save your searches for you and when clicked, they will once again bring up the current and five day forecast.
